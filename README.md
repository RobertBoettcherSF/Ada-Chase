# Chase Algorithm Implementation in Ada

Implementation of the Chase algorithm for database functional dependencies and its variants, written in Ada.

## Project Overview

This project implements the **Chase algorithm**, a fundamental algorithm in database theory used for testing and enforcing implication of data dependencies. The chase determines whether the projection of a relation schema constrained by functional dependencies onto a given decomposition can be recovered by rejoining the projections (lossless join property).

The implementation includes:
- Standard Chase algorithm for functional dependencies
- Oblivious (Naïve) Chase variant
- Core Chase variant
- Restricted Chase for Tuple-Generating Dependencies (TGDs)

## Features

### Implemented Variants
1. **Standard Chase**: The classic algorithm that applies functional dependencies to equate symbols in a tableau
2. **Oblivious Chase**: Eager variant that always adds new witnesses
3. **Core Chase**: Variant that tries to minimize the tableau by keeping only necessary tuples
4. **Restricted Chase for TGDs**: Generalization for tuple-generating dependencies

### Key Components
- **Tableau creation**: Initializes the tableau from a relation schema and decomposition
- **FD application**: Applies functional dependencies to equate symbols
- **Termination detection**: Checks when the tableau stabilizes
- **Result verification**: Determines if the original tuple is recovered

### Data Types
- `Attribute`: Represents attribute names
- `Value`: Represents values in the tableau (constants or variables with subscripts)
- `Tuple`: A row in the tableau
- `Functional_Dependency`: Represents a functional dependency (X → Y)
- `Tableau`: The matrix of values being chased
- `Decomposition`: A set of relation schemas

## Testing

### Test Philosophy
The test suite assumes the code is **broken or non-functional** and aims to disprove this assumption. Each test verifies that the code behaves correctly, with **PASS** indicating the pessimistic assumption was disproven (code works correctly).

### Test Categories
The 14+ tests cover:

1. **Functional Correctness** (Tests 1-5)
   - Standard Chase with Wikipedia example
   - Oblivious Chase variant
   - Core Chase variant
   - TGD Chase variant
   - Lossy vs. lossless decomposition detection

2. **Edge Cases** (Tests 6, 12)
   - Empty inputs (empty FD set, empty decomposition)
   - Single attribute tuples
   - Minimal configurations

3. **Error Handling** (Tests 7-8)
   - Value equality checks
   - Tableau creation validation
   - Attribute indexing

4. **Algorithm Verification** (Tests 9-11)
   - FD application correctness
   - Original tuple detection
   - Validation functions

5. **Variant Comparison** (Test 13)
   - All variants produce consistent results
   - All variants handle edge cases

6. **Performance & Termination** (Test 14)
   - Larger tuples
   - Cyclic FDs
   - Many FDs

### Why These Tests Matter
- **Verification**: Ensures the implementation matches the algorithm specification
- **Validation**: Confirms the code meets its intended use in database theory
- **Reliability**: Tests edge cases and error conditions for robustness
- **Correctness**: Validates against known examples (Wikipedia case)
- **Consistency**: Ensures all variants produce compatible results

### How Tests Prove the Code Works
Despite starting with the pessimistic assumption that the code is broken:
- Each **PASS** result disproves this assumption for a specific case
- Multiple independent tests covering different aspects increase confidence
- Edge case testing ensures robustness
- Variant comparison ensures consistency across implementations

## Usage

### Compilation
To compile the project:
